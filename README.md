# Singly-Link-List-Visualizer
I made a simple Singly Linked List Visuslizerr in python using Tkinter. Some of the functionality of Singly Link List I made here, they are:   

1.Insert node at first  
2.Insert node  at last  
3.Insert Node after a particular node  
4.Delete node from first  
5.Delete node from last  
6.Delete a particular node  

Learning Data Structure as well as possible, really inspires me to do that project. Through this functionality of that Link List, I want to make visualization of the logic of all that methods.
